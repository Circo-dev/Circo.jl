# How to contribute

As Circo is not yet useful in any real way, it doesn't seem very likely that you have bug reports
or you want to extend it for your needs. That may change soon, so please come back in a few months!

Still, if you would like to work on the foundations of the system, or you have design/implementation
suggestions, you are welcome! Please file an issue, or comment on an existing one!
